# Single Node Detection on Direction of Approach(DOA)

We have worked on detecting the UAVâ€™s DOA with a single node, which consists of two acoustic sensors and a Raspberry Pi, to overcome an acoustic sensor limitation through combining machine learning mechanisms (CNN, CRNN, ResNet50).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the code

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Training a model
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Inferencing with a trained model

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
